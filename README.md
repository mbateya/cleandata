### Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Peer-Reviewed Project
The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  

This repo "cleandata" contains the following files: 
 
1) "README.md": explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected   
2) "meansby_Activity_Subject.txt" : contains a tidy data set  
3) "CodeBook.md": a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data    
4) "runAnalysis.R": contains the R script used to merge the training and the test sets to create one data set, extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names, then from the data set in the previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set "meansby_Activity_Subject.txt" with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
